            <p>Is Frontend Development really coding?</p> <button onclick="hideElement('answer-1')" class="down-arrow"></button>

        <div class="answer" id="answer-1">
            <p>Do frontend developers really code? The answer is yes, absolutely.

                The fact that frontend developers are full-time developers who produce an output that is visually appealing (thanks to the designs provided by others) sometimes confuses others, making them believe that frontend developers aren’t really coding. However, that couldn’t be further from the truth.
                
                As a frontend developer, you’ll be coding all the time.
                
                While in some companies, the frontend developer is also a skilled designer or UX engineer, those are not the typical profiles. As a frontend dev, your learning focus should be coding-related (i.e coding best practices, software design patterns, frontend architecture, etc).</p>

            <p >Is Frontend Development a good career?</p> <button onclick="hideElement('answer-2')" class="down-arrow"></button>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer-2">
            <p>As the web space and technology in general continue to evolve, the role of frontend developers becomes more relevant. In the end, providing a web version of an application has quite a lot of benefits, making it the obvious version (unless there is a specific requirement forcing for native development) for most systems, meaning that frontend developers have the potential to be involved in all types of projects and companies.

                This renders the frontend developer career one of the most versatile and in-demand paths in the web tech industry.</p>

            <p>How to become a Frontend Development?</p> <button onclick="hideElement('answer-3')" class="down-arrow"></button>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer-3">
            <p>You can become a frontend developer by starting with learning HTML and CSS. Don't wait to fully master these and start building simple projects as soon as possible. You could try rebuilding the frontend of your favorite websites using HTML and CSS to start with. Do as many of these projects as possible as you keep learning. Once you are somewhat comfortable with HTML and CSS, start learning some basic JavaScript (DOM manipulation, making backend calls with Fetch or Axios, etc) and learn how to add interactivity to your websites. While you are at it, learn some basics of Git and GitHub. At this point, you should be able to get an entry-level frontend development job. Keep revisiting this roadmap and try to fill the gaps in your knowledge.</p>
